        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Paul, and this page is intended to provide some inspiration about a passion of mine: the outdoors and traveling to national parks in the USA.</p>
        <p>I am originally from Germany, and moved to the United States about 5 years ago for school. In my time here, I have traveled to 42 states and 35 of the 61 US national parks. I enjoy all kinds of outdoor activities, including backcountry skiing, rock climbing, backpacking, and camping, and I love designing taylored trips for my friends by drawing from memories of my 25+ roadtrips in the US. This page is an opportunity to share this passion with a few more people, and to share a few of my favorite circuits with the world.</p>

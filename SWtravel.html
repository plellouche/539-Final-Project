    <div class ="OverviewBlurb">
        I first made my way to the southwestern United States my sophomore year of college, and I have been back many times since. The region is absolutely breathtaking, both from its vast and barren landscapes and from its interesting cultural blend with strong influences from Mexico and various native american tribes who have called this region home for millenia.
        This itinerary will take you through a few of my personal highlights, a healthy mix of beautiful national parks and monuments, as well as opportunities to enjoy the food and southwestern culture. Make sure to stop frequently and engage with the kind locals, as I have found that there is so much to learn from people with drastically different surroundings and lifestyles, and this particularly holds true in this region of the US.
        Please note that the guide below merely serves as a framework for suggestions based on my personal experience, feel free to modify it to suit your liking.

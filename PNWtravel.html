        This itinerary takes you through my personal favorite part of the country: Northern California and the pacific northwest. From the high Sierras all the way to the Cascades, this trip will take you through magestic mountain ranges with beautiful exposed granits, as well as lush evergreen forests and alpine lakes.
        To complement this itinerary and access more recommendations of mine, please visit <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4xshjAeyMab5htV6?g_st=i">this custom map</a>. Living in San Francisco gave me great access to multiple stops along this itinerary, and will hopefully allow you to find a few of my favorite hidden gems.
        Please note that the guide below merely serves as a framework for suggestions based on my personal experience, feel free to modify it to suit your liking.

        <h2>Itinerary</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="Day1Blurb">
        <h3>Day 1: San Francisco</h3>
        <br>
        Start off this trip exploring the iconic city of San Francisco. If this is your first time in the city, you may want to take an extra day at this stop to see the many sights of the city by the bay.
        If not, take a stroll around North Beach and enjoy a slice of garlic-clam pizza at Golden Boy pizza or the famous Cioppino at Sotto Mare.
        Next, start your 3.5 hour drive to Yosemite National Park. I recommend getting on the road early enough to be able to catch the sunset in Yosemite, they are magical. Set up camp at Camp 4 in the Yosemite valley and enjoy some time around a campfire.

    <div class="Day2Blurb">
        <h3>Day 2: Yosemite NP</h3>
        <br>
        Make your way to the Upper Yosemite Falls trailhead which is located right by camp 4 and embark on a strenuous but rewarding 8.4 mile hike to Yosemite Point (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/yosemite-point#:~:text=Enjoy%20this%208.4%2Dmile%20out,encounter%20other%20people%20while%20exploring.">AllTrails Link</a>). Take in the beautiful vistas and enjoy a picnic on the iconic Granite.
        On your way down, take a small detour and do a polar plunge in the upper Yosemite falls if you are up for it. Reward yourself with a hearty campfire meal at camp 4, and enjoy the view of climbers making camp on the face of Sentinel Dome around nightfall.

    <div class="Day3Blurb">
        <h3>Day 3: Lake Tahoe</h3>
        <br>
        Make the 4 hour drive to lake Tahoe through the beautiful high Sierras. Don't hesitate to pull over if you see vista points on this route, there are many of them and they are worth the stop.
        Arrive in Tahoe and have brunch at the Red Hut Cafe. Enjoy the rest of the day hiking and dipping in the lake at Emerald Bay State Park, and either make camp at DL Bliss Lower Pines campground or one of the many comfortable lakefront cabins around the lake.

    <div class="Day4Blurb">
        <h3>Day 4: Lassen Volcanic NP</h3>
        <br>
        Continue your northbound journey with a 3 hour drive to Lassen Volcanic National Park, one of the least visited national parks and one of only a handful of areas in the world where all 4 types of volcanoes can be found.
        Grab lunch at the Shingletown farmer's market, and make your way into the park where you can either explore the geothermal wonders of the Bumpass Hell, or for a more active afternoon hike the Lassen Peak Summit trail (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/lassen-peak">All Trails Link</a>)
        Make camp at Manzanita lake campground, and take in the views of the sun setting over the crystal clear Manzanita lake. If you prefer a more comfortable camping experience, Manzanita lake also offers cabins for rental.

    <div class="Day5Blurb">
        <h3>Day 5: Crater Lake NP</h3>
        <br>
        Make the 5 hour drive north to Crater Lake National Park in Oregon, a mystical caldera and one of the deepest lakes in the world. Spend the day one one of the many hikes in the park, and take a polar plunge in Crater Lake if you are up for it. Stay at the crater lake lodge for an unmatched view of the lake and great food.

    <div class="Day6Blurb">
        <h3>Day 6: Portland & Mount Rainier NP</h3>
        <br>
        Make the 6 hour drive north to our penultimate stop, Mount Rainier National Park in Washington. Stop in Portland, Oregon, for a bite to eat; I personally recommend Eem Thai BBQ. Rest up from the long drive at Cougar Rock Campground.

    <div class="Day7Blurb">
        <h3>Day 7: Mount Rainier NP</h3>
        <br>
        Enjoy a full day in one of America's most underrated National Parks. There are a plethora of hikes to chose from, but I personally recommend Panorama Point via Skyline Trail (<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/panorama-point-via-skyline-trail#:~:text=Get%20to%20know%20this%203.8,encounter%20other%20people%20while%20exploring.">All Trails Link</a>)
        Take in the beauty on your last day in the wilderness, and try to spot your favorite constellations in the dark skies of Mount Rainier NP

        Wrap up your trip with a 2 hour drive to Seattle, WA. Visit the iconic Pike's Place market, and take in the sights of the city.
